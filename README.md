# Flask-Template
Most of my projects use the same basic stack: Flask, Bootstrap 4, and jQuery. Flask requires a bunch of directories to be set up in a strict fashion, and has hard-to-remember syntax for including templates. Bootstrap can be loaded from a CDN, which requires me to look up the link every time. Same for jQuery. I also usually include the same favicon and footer.
By putting this all into a template repository, I am saving myself at least two minutes of work.

## Dependencies
`pip install flask`

## Running
`python3 app.py`
